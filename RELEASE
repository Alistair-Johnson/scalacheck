ScalaCheck 1.10.1 Release Notes

Author: Rickard Nilsson <rickynils@gmail.com>

ScalaCheck is a powerful tool for automatic unit testing of Scala and Java
programs. It features automatic test case generation and simplification of
failing test cases. ScalaCheck started out as a straightforward Scala port of
the Haskell library QuickCheck, and has since wandered off on its own. Most
features of QuickCheck can be found in ScalaCheck and vice versa, though.


ScalaCheck highlights:

  * Specifications are written in Scala, in a DSL-like fashion using
    combinators from the ScalaCheck library.

  * Properties are tested automatically, with test data generated by
    ScalaCheck. Data generation can be precisely controlled, and generation
    of custom data types is simple to define.

  * Failing test cases are simplified automatically, which makes pin-pointing
    error causes easier.

  * Support for stateful testing of command sequences, and simplification of
    failing command sequences.

  * The ScalaCheck library has no dependencies other than the Scala
    runtime.

  * ScalaCheck is well integrated with ScalaTest, SBT and Specs.


What's new in version 1.10.1?

Since version 1.10.0 was released, minor additions and fixes has been made.
Also, the code has been adapted to Scala 2.10.

All ScalaCheck releases in the 1.10.x series should be considered binary
compatible so if you have been using ScalaCheck 1.10.0 you should just be able
to drop in 1.10.1. There have been some deprecations in 1.10.1 though, so you
might get compilation warnings. If you run into any more serious problems it
should be considered a bug and would merit a re-release.

Builds of ScalaCheck 1.10.1 are available for Scala versions from 1.9.0 up to
2.10.1. New builds are added when new versions of Scala is released. If you
miss any build, please submit an issue at GitHub. I have stopped doing sbaz
builds, if you miss them please submit an issue.
